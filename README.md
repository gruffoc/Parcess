Pathfinder for taking the necessary experience with QThread class. 

The primary goal of the project is to create a highly responsive GUI in which every process is moved on different threads.
All threads are working in a cooperative network, sharing message and information about the percentage accomplishment of every process.

Another different thread must be synchronized with the others and must be run just all the others end.
